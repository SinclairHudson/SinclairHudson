### Hello Hello 👋

I'm Sinclair, and I'm currently a machine learning engineer at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/).
In May 2023, I completed my Bachelor's of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, with 6 internships.
In Dec 2024, I completed my Master's of Applied Computing at the University of Toronto.

My current (2025 Q1) research interests include:
* 🚙 Robotics (specifically autonomous vehicles)
* 🏋️ Self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning
* 🔊 ML for audio
* 🎨 AI for creative and artistic applications (specifically video editing and effects)

I'm not interested in the following research topics:
* 🪖 weapons or defense technology
* 📱 recommendation algorithms that exacerbate social media addiction

More generally, I'm interested in exploring creative research ideas that redefine problems or disrupt entrenched approaches.
