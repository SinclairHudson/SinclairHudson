### Hello Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sinclair, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's of Applied Computing at the University of Toronto.
I love learning new things, creating cool projects, and solving problems.
This is my GitHub profile, which has some (but not all!) of my work.
I've done a lot of projects in computer vision, and currently I'm looking at generative models applied to audio.
My preferred language is Python of course, because of PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas.
Also, I'm a huge Vim nerd.
